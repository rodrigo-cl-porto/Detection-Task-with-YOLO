# Detection-Task-with-YOLO
Object detection task in images by using YOLO model

In this repo, it was used the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, version 11, for detection task. The model was trained with the [COCO128 dataset](https://docs.ultralytics.com/pt/datasets/detect/coco128/#introduction), which, according to Ultralitics,

> is a small, but versatile object detection dataset composed of the first 128 images of the COCO train 2017 set. This dataset is ideal for testing and debugging object detection models, or for experimenting with new detection approaches. With 128 images, it is small enough to be easily manageable, yet diverse enough to test training pipelines for errors and act as a sanity check before training larger datasets.

Both YOLOv11 and COCO128 were imported from [Ultralitics website](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/). The result of task detection are on `runs` folder.
